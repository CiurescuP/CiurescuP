### ◐ Hello! I am a Junior Front End Developer, excited for the future! ◑

➣ 👩‍💻 I like to create, design, code, repeat.

➣ 🎮 Huge love for video games; from design, to stories, to playthrough

➣ 🌪️ Currently working on all types of projects 🌪️

➣ 🏆 Goal: Be the person I needed when I was younger. 

➣ 🎨 Been on computers and Playstations before I could walk. Maybe that's where all my creativity comes from?
