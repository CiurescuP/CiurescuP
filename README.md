◐ Hi, I'm a Junior Front End Developer, excited for the future! ◑

➣ 👩‍💻 I like to imagine, create, code, and sometimes design.

➣ 🎮 Huge love for video games; from design, to stories, to playthrough.

➣ 🌪️ Currently working on my future.

➣ 🏆 Goal: Become the person I've always wanted to be.

➣ 🎨 Been on computers and Playstations before I could walk. Maybe that's where all my creativity comes from?
